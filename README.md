# Tableau-HansRosling_Gapminder_Viz
Public Health Dashboard – Extending Hans Rosling.

For this option, you will first re-create Hans Rosling’s Gapminder visualization that we can be viewed at (https://youtu.be/usdJgEwMinM?t=2m41s).

To do this, you will import the four text files that are uploaded into a new TABLEAU PACKAGED WORKBOOK. You will need to properly join the data as per the following instructions:

Countries by Continent joins with Life Expectancy by the Country field.
Fertility joins with Life Expectancy by the Country and Year fields.
Population joins with Life Expectancy by the Country and Year fields.

NOTES:
1.	Make the country circles partially transparent so that you can see when countries are overlapping.
2.	Tableau tries to automatically link your data sources – often you just have to tell it to use the links, BUT make sure that you blend on the right fields, or you will get days-long queries.

Finally,
•	Add the GDPData.xls to your data source.
•	Include the GDP data as part of a TOOLTIP in your Rosling Chart.
